# tic-tac-toe-project
The Tic Tac Toe Project for the 2022 WIT Spring Break bootcamp

# How It Works 

To represent tic-tac-toe boards in this program, we use a dictionary with keys '1' through '9' for the spaces on the board. The numbered spaces are arranged in the same way as a phone’s keypad. The values in this dictionary are the string 'X' or 'O' for a player’s mark and ' ' for an empty space. 

## Exploring the Program 

Try to find the answers to the following questions. Experiment with some modifications to the code and rerun the program to see what effect the changes have. 
    1.What happens if you change X, O, BLANK = 'X', 'O', ' ' on line 7 toX, O, BLANK = 'X', 'X', ' '? 
    2.What happens if you change board[space] = mark on line 95 to board[space] = X? 
    3.What happens if you change board[space] = BLANK on line 50 to board[space] = X?
